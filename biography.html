              			      <p dir="ltr">It was October 29th, 1954 and the warm and savage coast of Morocco along with several travels to Spain and the Canary islands will be the scenario of the childhood of the Artist who due to he condition was born to travel since the very beginning</p>
              			      <p dir="ltr">France never saw pleasantly Spanish designation to control that part of the Sahara. Morocco &nbsp;after being an independent country fiercely tried to recover Sidi Ifni with a series of independentist wars that ended with Spain giving Sidi Ifni to Morocco and the Artist coming back to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
                              
              			      <p dir="ltr">Paz Arés said She was happy during her childhood but obviously She was in continuous contact with the problems related with International Conflicts. </p>
              			      <p dir="ltr">She, as a child, witnessed several independentist wars against Spain in the small city She was living in and many of the Spanish people around died during those wars. </p>
                              <p>From the very beginning nonetheless the Artist had a feeling of transcendency and happiness in conflict scenarios.</p>
              			      <p dir="ltr">It can be seen in the Artist portfolio some painting related with the desert and the islamic culture. Always from the total respect, She talks about the desire of women to be unveiled and the peace and freedom of the desert.</p>
              			      <p dir="ltr">The Artist&rsquo;s father was a general of Spain designated by Spanish Army to run Sidi Ifni territories office both the presidency of the Government of Spain and a part of Spanish Army designated to manage African colonies designated him to manage the offices of both the Government of Spain and the Army of Spain in Sidi Ifni. It is remarkable than the grandfather of the Artist was also designated in Sidi Ifni until 1925.</p> 
                              <blockquote> Life is full of paradoxes, who would have said we as a family would return to that coastal African spot, maybe I was meant to born between the desert and the sea just to learn the difference and God&rsquo;s everywhere presence</blockquote>
              			      <p dir="ltr">Particularly in the war of 1958 many Spaniards died. The Artist is influenced by these feelings of war and international conflicts but at the same time the Global &nbsp;feeling was born into her.
                              </p>
                              <blockquote> &nbsp;&ldquo; I am Spain and at the same time I am Africa, I was born there, and spent the most of my childhood in Sidi Ifni in front of the sea, the Atlantic Ocean. The sea doesn&rsquo;t understand what a country is. Even the Earth doesn&rsquo;t understand. The mix of the culture from Spain and the culture from Africa is sometimes hard to mingle, maybe they had a better democratic system to lead the tribes of the desert that we have in Spain nowadays.&rdquo;</blockquote>
                              <p> In any case, the Artist will always have Africa deep in her heart...</p>
              			     <blockquote> &quot;We were always playing, we were always together. A lot friendships I made in Sidi Ifni. We spent intense moments playing in the fields and the streets of Sidi Ifni, swimming in the Ocean. The city was quite small but the intensity of the watm dances and parties was as high as in the rest of Spain. I remember reading a lot in the desert and I loved reading, maybe that was the origin of the passion I have always had with literature and part of my professional experience is very related with Art and Literature. I love Africa and I love Spain and I love Earth&rdquo;</blockquote>

              			      <blockquote> I fell in love with the Mediterranean Sea and the party in Valencia called &ldquo;Las Fallas&rdquo; where how short things are in life is recognized.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transitory nature of events in life is part of the culture of the party, big monuments are manufactured through all the year and burnt in the 19th of March.</blockquote>
              			      <p dir="ltr">In 1971, the family moved to Avila where She will end up her studies as a teacher being one of the four more brilliant students in the whole country, this is one of the reasons She was granted a direct access to the State Public Servants body. She began as a teacher in Avila in a School related with the Teachers College of Avila.</p>
              			      <blockquote> Avila is one of the most cities in the planet. Without a doubt. Art and spirituality can be witnessed in every corner. The Walls of Avila reminds you of old times where the Islam was governing Spain and Christians reconquer the lands being born the kingdom of Spain. At the same time you can imagine saints of the category of Saint Theresa walking through those mystical streets of Avila. You can see a vision of the rural Spain and the very best of modernity in Avila. Some of the most relevant politicians of Spain in the last decades started their careers in Avila, remarkably the great Adolfo Suarez, who was able to bring peace to Spain in a period of high tension without blood spills. This is the time when I have lived in Avila but I cannot forget the shadows of Saint Theresa which will always remain in this holy city. </blockquote>
              			      <p dir="ltr">Being in Avila the Artist began her second and third careers with the Spanish National University for non presencial education (UNED). It can be see a deep interest to go through into the deeps of human being. She is a teacher but She&rsquo;ll never stop studying new issues. This can be seen like the beginning of a huge spiritual research, trying to find answers in Philosophy about the main questions of human being in Earth. At the same time Psychology career can be seen as an approach to the same deeps of the human being through the eyes of modern science and research about the human brain. </p>
              			      <blockquote>Studying psychology and philosophy was interesting to say one word. Nevertheless it is inside oneself where you can find real answers to real questions. In the essence all philosophers even all religions can collaborate instead of confront because they are all looking to express the same reality. &nbsp;It is our mission as artists to be able to transmit or to inspire illumination in all human beings. In between the lines of our art creations we &nbsp;put our energy which will inspire &nbsp;all people who read between lines to have the same feelings we had when conveying our soul through different kinds of art expression. In essence we are all artists in the moment we want to get across our feelings in a balanced combination of heart and mind.</blockquote>
              			      <p dir="ltr">In these years She met doctor Felipe de Torres, one of the leaders of vegetarian movement in Spain and She realized the big importance of the vegetarian culture. At that time it was quite difficult to access to non conventional medicine and vegetarianism but She saw the importance of it and joined the movements.</p>
              			      <blockquote>Vegetarian culture is the only one truly respectful with mother Earth. A truly vegetarian diet would put an end to many diseases at the time that would put an end to starvation in the Earth. Earth can give us enough vegetal food for all to be healthy and for as to be respectful with animals. I know we live in a society where we kill animals to eat although we don&rsquo;t need it. It is something of old generations who were unable to grow vegetables and so lived like animals killing and eating animals. &nbsp;The moment we begin to be more humans than animals will be the moment we will cease killing other life forms just to eat, respect and love to all life forms is what society need to put deep into culture. Big advances have been seen during last years with initiatives like Greenpeace to which I subscribe, but much more advances we need to see in order to evolve and permit mother Nature to subsist.</blockquote>

She created a family, later She would divorce, you can see that She needed to grow as an Artist and that implied sacrifices. The Artist has always been there for all but many people always thought She was too devoted to her inner growth to put all her soul in her blood family.</p>
           			        <p dir="ltr">All we do in our life implies sacrifices one way or another. We are not always understand and maybe it has to be the with the pass of time that people begin to understand the message we want to get across or get to understand why we did the things we did. It is more about heart than about mind sometimes.</p>
           			        <p dir="ltr"> </p>
           			        <p dir="ltr">The Artist was teaching in Madrid and in Huelva (south of Spain near Portugal) in several schools. She remember specially San Fernando School where children with social problems attended and with this the Artist have to deal with fraternity and solidarity values. Since 1984 She spent 30 years working as teacher in las Rozas in Retamar School and combining that work with an intense artist life.</p>
           			        <p dir="ltr">No matter where the child came from, they are not waste but the future. God lies inside every one and the work of the master in this kind of schools is not just to teach Math and Language but also to teach that they are human beings as respectful as any other ones and no matter where they were born if they do good to society they will be as respectful as any other person in Earth. It is in our actions and not in the actions of our parents where we tell the world who we are. Maybe it is not easy to detach from violence when all you witnessed in your childhood was violence.</p>
           			        <p dir="ltr">In 1981 Paz Arés had a <span id="firstenlightment"><b>first enlightment</b></span> experience dealing with Christian special courses calle&quot;<a href="http://www.cursillo.org/">Cursillo</a>&quot;... Cursillo is a Christian movement based on the transformation of a person in a being of colours. You have to get Christ view and go beyond (Ultreya) in your inner personal improvement. In Cursillos there is a big practice on experiencing happiness with all that surround us, this is like to take Jesus way of thinking to the current personal issues.</p>
           			        <blockquote>Maybe it is not the course the thing that transform you but to feel the energy of a master, to put yourself in the feet of master Jesus and try to act like him. With this syntony illumination comes easily. &nbsp;Later in my life I saw this same feeling with Buddha or any other spiritual master I followed. With time I prefered to follow living ones like Amma, but we have to always focus on that this is our path. Masters show you somehow a way, you have to walk it, just praising is good, but imitating is better, and being oneself is the top.</blockquote>

              			      <p style="text-align: justify; padding:5px"> 1984, the artist takes the <b> <a href="http://www.silvalifesystem.com/">Silva Mind Control Method</a></b> that deals with the Power of the subconscious mind. Some of the most influential people of the XX century such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bach" title="Richard Bach">Richard Bach</a> and <a href="http://www.drwaynedyer.com/">Wayne Dyer</a> back the Silva Mind Method which is one of the main precursors of the new age philosophies. Mind is creative and mind can is so powerful that virtually we create what we think. Movements like "<a href="http://thesecret.tv/">The Secret</a>" are following some of the consequences stated by the Silva Mind Method.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify; padding:5px">In 1984, the artist officially starts her studies on Art expression, attending some workshops about painting, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_enamel">vitreous enamel</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic">ceramic</a> art expressions.
